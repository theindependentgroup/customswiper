      <h2 class="f3 mb0">The Name</h2>
      <p class="">The Independent Group (UK) consisted of artists, architects, writers, and critics that met and collaborated informally in London from 1952–55. Together they explored a range of concerns, including questioning dominant Modernist thought and the role of waste in popular culture. Their approach was inclusive and multi-disciplinary, and the influences they drew upon were diverse. It is this spirit that guides our approach: We are invested in making collaborative work that is innovative, timely, and has a lasting impact.</p>
